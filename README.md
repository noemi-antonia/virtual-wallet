# Angular Playground - JS Course

## First Course

We installed Angular locally and made, as an example, a to-do list app.

### Homework

1. Setup an Angular application
  - install NodeJS to have access to npm
  - install Angular CLI from a terminal
2. Create the following components using Angular CLI:
  - header
  - dashboard> shall contain a todolist component which will contain:
    - list of items
    - input and a button to add items to the list
    - button to delete an item from the list
  - footer

## Second Course

We included the angular material library in the project. We populated the header of the application with some cards from the library.
After that, we created an injectable service class. In the service class, we made an API request, which collects the data of some coins. 
We populated the cards with that data. In the end, we created an interval to refresh the data.

The used API: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api

### Homework

We had to do something similar for homework. The cards had to be inserted in the dashboard component, and other data had to be displayed: the logo, the current price, and when was the last update.
